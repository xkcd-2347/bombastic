# **NOTE:** Because of Helm dependency hell, all those versions must be in sync! In case of transient dependencies,
# like keycloak -> postgres -> common, one might end up with different versions of those transient dependencies. If
# that's the case, then it might just crash and burn, as Helm can't handle different versions of the same chart.

# **NOTE:** Also because of Helm dependency Hell, it is not possible to enable keycloak and postgresql at the same
# time. The reason is that both installations will create the same resources, creating a conflict in the deployment.
# When enabling keycloak, you automatically enable postgresql too. I order to use postgresql when keycloak is disabled,
# you can still enable postgresql independently.
